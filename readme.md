# Physics

## About

I am using this library to experiment with 3D physic engines for web. Might change this into a game if things work out.

## Local Development

 - Install NodeJS package libraries: `npm install`
 - Run development libraries `npm run dev`
 - Open app on any basic server (ex: I like to use the VSCode "Express" plugin to enable `http://localhost/build/`). On Chrome, you can "Load unpacked" libraries within the popup.

## Deployment
 - Run build with `npm run build` (This greatly reduces the JS size)

## Questions
 - Why Webpack? I just discovered it, and I'm in love with it. I can easily import JS libraries and it bundles them into a single lightweight JS file.
